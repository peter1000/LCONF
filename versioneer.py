=============

This is a tool for managing a recorded version number in distutils-based python projects.
The goal is to remove the tedious and error-prone 'update the embedded version string' step from your release process.
Making a new release should be as easy as recording a new tag in your version-control system, and maybe making new tarballs.


Version Identifiers
-------------------

Source trees come from a variety of places:

* a version-control system checkout (mostly used by developers)
* a nightly tarball, produced by build automation
* a snapshot tarball, produced by a web-based VCS browser, like github's 'tarball from tag' feature
* a release tarball, produced by 'setup.py sdist', distributed through PyPI

Within each source tree, the version identifier (either a string or a number, this tool is format-agnostic) can come from a
variety of places:

* ask the VCS tool itself, e.g. 'git describe' (for checkouts), which knows about recent 'tags' and an absolute revision-id
* the name of the directory into which the tarball was unpacked
* an expanded VCS keyword ($Id$, etc)
* a `_version.py` created by some earlier build step

For released software, the version identifier is closely related to a VCS tag. Some projects use tag names that include more
than just the version string (e.g. 'my_project-1.2' instead of just '1.2'), in which case the tool needs to strip the tag
prefix to extract the version identifier. For unreleased software (between tags), the version identifier should provide
enough information to help developers recreate the same tree, while also giving them an idea of roughly how old the tree is
(after version 1.2, before version 1.3).

Many VCS systems can report a description that captures this, for example 'git describe --tags --dirty --always' reports
things like '0.7-1-g574ab98-dirty' to indicate that the checkout is one revision past the 0.7 tag, has a unique revision id
of '574ab98', and is 'dirty' (it has uncommitted changes.)

The version identifier is used for multiple purposes:

* to allow the module to self-identify its version: `my_project.__version__`
* to choose a name and prefix for a 'setup.py sdist' tarball


Theory of Operation
-------------------

Versioneer works by adding a special `_version.py` file into your source tree, where your `__init__.py` can import it.
This `_version.py` knows how to dynamically ask the VCS tool for version information at import time. However, when you use
'setup.py build' or 'setup.py sdist', `_version.py` in the new copy is replaced by a small static file that contains just the
generated version data.

`_version.py` also contains `$Revision$` markers, and the installation process marks `_version.py` to have this marker
rewritten with a tag name during the 'git archive' command. As a result, generated tarballs will contain enough information
to get the proper version.


Installation
------------

First, decide on values for the following configuration variables:

* `VCS`: the version control system you use. Currently accepts 'git'.

* `versionfile_source`:

   A project-relative pathname into which the generated version strings should be written. This is usually a `_version.py`
   next to your project's main `__init__.py` file. If your project uses `src/my_project/__init__.py`, this should be
   `src/my_project/_version.py`. This file should be checked in to your VCS as usual: the copy created below by `setup.py
   versioneer` will include code that parses expanded VCS keywords in generated tarballs. The 'build' and 'sdist' commands
   will replace it with a copy that has just the calculated version string.

*   `versionfile_build`:

   Like `versionfile_source`, but relative to the build directory instead of the source directory. These will differ when
   your setup.py uses 'package_dir='. If you have `package_dir={'my_project': 'src/my_project'}`, then you will probably have
   `versionfile_build='my_project/_version.py'` and `versionfile_source='src/my_project/_version.py'`.

* `tag_prefix`:

   a string, like 'PROJECTNAME-', which appears at the start of all VCS tags. If your tags look like 'my_project-1.2.0', then
   you should use tag_prefix='my_project-'. If you use unprefixed tags like '1.2.0', this should be an empty string.

* `parentdir_prefix`:

   a string, frequently the same as tag_prefix, which appears at the start of all unpacked tarball filenames. If your tarball
   unpacks into 'my_project-1.2.0', this should be 'my_project-'.


To versioneer-enable your project:
----------------------------------

* 1: Copy `versioneer.py` into the top of your source tree.

* 2: add the following lines to the top of your `setup.py`, with the configuration values you decided earlier::

   import versioneer
   versioneer.VCS = 'git'
   versioneer.versionfile_source = 'src/my_project/_version.py'
   versioneer.versionfile_build = 'my_project/_version.py'
   versioneer.tag_prefix = '' # tags are like 1.2.0
   versioneer.parentdir_prefix = 'my_project-' # dirname like 'my_project-1.2.0'

* 3: add the following arguments to the setup() call in your setup.py::

   version=versioneer.get_version(),
   cmdclass=versioneer.get_cmdclass(),

* 4: now run `setup.py versioneer`, which will create `_version.py`, and will modify your `__init__.py` to define
   `__version__` (by calling a function from `_version.py`). It will also modify your `MANIFEST.in` to include both
   `versioneer.py` and the generated `_version.py` in sdist tarballs.

* 5: commit these changes to your VCS. To make sure you won't forget, `setup.py versioneer` will mark everything it touched
   for addition.


Post-Installation Usage
-----------------------

Once established, all uses of your tree from a VCS checkout should get the current version string. All generated tarballs
should include an embedded version string (so users who unpack them will not need a VCS tool installed).

If you distribute your project through PyPI, then the release process should boil down to two steps:

* 1: git tag 1.0
* 2: python setup.py register sdist upload

If you distribute it through github (i.e. users use github to generate tarballs with `git archive`), the process is:

* 1: git tag 1.0
* 2: git push; git push --tags

Currently, all version strings must be based upon a tag. Versioneer will report 'unknown' until your tree has at least one
tag in its history. This restriction will be fixed eventually (see issue #12).


Version-String Flavors
----------------------

Code which uses Versioneer can learn about its version string at runtime by importing `version` from your main `__init__.py`
file and running the `get_versions()` function. From the 'outside' (e.g. in `setup.py`), you can   import the top-level
`versioneer.py` and run `get_versions()`.

Both functions return a dictionary with different keys for different flavors of the version string:

* `['version']`: condensed tag+distance+ shortid+dirty identifier. For git, this uses the output of
   `git describe --tags --dirty --always` but strips the tag_prefix. For example '0.11-2-g1076c97-dirty' indicates that the
   tree is like the '1076c97' commit but has uncommitted changes ('-dirty'), and that this commit is two revisions ('-2-')
   beyond the '0.11' tag. For released software (exactly equal to a known tag), the identifier will only contain the stripped
   tag, e.g. '0.11'.

* `['full']`: detailed revision identifier. For Git, this is the full SHA1 commit id, followed by '-dirty' if the tree
   contains uncommitted changes, e.g. '1076c978a8d3cfc70f408fe5974aa6c092c949ac-dirty'.

Some variants are more useful than others. Including `full` in a bug report should allow developers to reconstruct the exact
code being tested (or indicate the presence of local changes that should be shared with the developers). `version` is
suitable for display in an 'about' box or a CLI `--version` output: it can be easily compared against release notes and lists
of bugs fixed in various releases.

In the future, this will also include a [PEP-0440](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/) -compatible flavor
(e.g. `1.2.post0.dev123`). This loses a lot of information (and has no room for a hash-based revision id), but is safe to use
in a `setup.py` '`version=`' argument. It also enables tools like *pip* to compare version strings and evaluate
compatibility constraint declarations.

The `setup.py versioneer` command adds the following text to your `__init__.py` to place a basic version
in `YOUR_PROJECT.__version__`::

   from LCONF.version import get_versions
   __version__ = get_versions()['version']
   del get_versions


Updating Versioneer
-------------------

To upgrade your project to a new release of Versioneer, do the following:

* install the new Versioneer (`pip install -U versioneer` or equivalent)
* re-run `versioneer-installer` in your source tree to replace your copy of `versioneer.py`
* edit `setup.py`, if necessary, to include any new configuration settings indicated by the release notes
* re-run `setup.py versioneer` to replace `SRC/_version.py`
* commit any changed files


Upgrading from 0.10 to 0.11
---------------------------

You must add a `versioneer.VCS = 'git'` to your `setup.py` before re-running `setup.py versioneer`. This will enable the use
of additional version-control systems (SVN, etc) in the future.


Future Directions
-----------------

This tool is designed to make it easily extended to other version-control systems: all VCS-specific components are in
separate directories like src/git/ . The top-level `versioneer.py` script is assembled from these components by running
make-versioneer.py . In the future, make-versioneer.py will take a VCS name as an argument, and will construct a version of
`versioneer.py` that is specific to the given VCS. It might also take the configuration arguments that are currently provided
manually during installation by editing setup.py . Alternatively, it might go the other direction and include code from all
supported VCS systems, reducing the number of intermediate scripts.
